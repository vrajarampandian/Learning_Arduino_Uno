# Arduino & Embedded Systems Learning Journey

Welcome to my Arduino Uno, Embedded Systems, and IoT learning repository! This repo tracks all my hands-on projects, experiments, and progress as I explore the world of electronics, sensors, microcontrollers, and real‑time applications.

---

## 📘 **About This Repository**

This repository contains:

* Arduino Uno mini‑projects
* Qt-based desktop UI integrations
* Embedded systems learning logs
* IoT exploration and prototypes

I will continue updating this repo as I learn more concepts and build more projects.

## 🚀 **Completed Projects**

### 1️⃣ **Room Temperature Monitor**

A simple temperature-sensing system using Arduino Uno.

* Reads temperature from a sensor (DHT11)
* Sends data via serial communication
* Displays live temperature in a Qt desktop application
* Useful for understanding ADC, serial communication, and sensor calibration

### 2️⃣ **Traffic Light Control System (with Qt UI)**

A simulation of a traffic light controller.

* Arduino Uno controls LEDs representing signals
* Qt application sends commands and displays status
* Helps understand timing functions, state machines, and UI integration

## 📚 **Current Learning Focus**

I am actively learning:

### 🔹 Arduino Uno Programming

* Digital/analog I/O
* Timers and PWM
* Interrupts
* Serial/I2C/SPI communication

### 🔹 Embedded Systems Concepts

* Memory architecture
* Real-time programming
* Microcontroller programming basics
* Sensors and actuators

### 🔹 IoT (Internet of Things)

* Using Arduino with Wi-Fi modules (ESP8266/ESP32)
* Sending sensor data to cloud dashboards
* Building simple IoT prototypes

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used**

* **Arduino Uno R3**
* **C/C++ (Arduino IDE)**
* **Qt (C++ UI Framework)**
* **Sensors:** temperature sensor, LEDs, resistors
* **Git/GitHub** for version control

## 📝 **How to Run the Projects**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

2. Open Arduino project folders in **Arduino IDE**
3. Connect Arduino Uno via USB
4. Upload the code and run the corresponding Qt UI

## 🎯 **Goal of This Learning Path**

My long‑term goal is to gain strong knowledge in:

* Embedded programming
* IoT systems design
* Performance‑critical C++ applications
* Sensor‑driven real‑time systems

This repository will serve as my portfolio and progress tracker.
